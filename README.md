ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Deni Ramdani

I'm a physics graduate from Institut Teknologi Bandung, where I specialized in computational photonic physics. With nearly six years of experience tutoring physics, I've loved helping others understand the wonders of science. Now, I'm ready for a new adventure and am excited to dive into the world of data analysis! I'm really looking forward to exploring data science and machine learning, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me. Let's connect!
